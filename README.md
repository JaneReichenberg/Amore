# Amore, the fake Italian Restaurant

Amore is a fake website for an Italian restaurant created with React. It features a home page with navbar, a menu, and a contact/reservation page. It also manages state with Redux, shows animations with react-animations, and styles with reactstrap. On the reservation page, you can submit your information and the page will show a pop-up window with what you typed and then clear the page. If you type in some information, navigate away from that page, and come back, the information you typed will still be there.  

## Practice, practice

I created Amore as practice, as I aim to be a front-end engineer. I wanted to work on a multi-page application, state management, and overall design.
